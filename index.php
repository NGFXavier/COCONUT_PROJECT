      <h1 class="w3-center">About Ceylon Coconut Foundation</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1889</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Set in the Indian Ocean in South Asia, the tropical island nation of Sri Lanka has a history dating back to the birth of time. Sri Lanka, the natures treasure chest is the home to one of the oldest civilizations in the world.

Its location on the silk route brought many adventurous travellers to its shores. Marco Polo, Iban Battuta and the Portuguese seafarers would have stepped off their boats on to the island’s Coconut palm-fringed beaches. They would have rested under their shade, as the gentle and welcoming islanders would have offered them voluptuous coconut fruits filled to the brim with sweet coconut water to quench their thirst. </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Three like-minded, home grown entrepreneurs, with a singular love for all things coconut, and vast family owned working coconut estates, was the magical combination that gave rise to a vision that evolved into the Ceylon Coconut Foundation. Ceylon Coconut Foundation’s is a philosophy that goes to the very heart of your life and the way you want to live it.
